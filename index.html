                I am an 11 year old programmer from Canada. I know Python, JavaScript, C#,
                C++, C, and a little bit of Java (Can't say HTML). I love learning about math and computers, as
                well
                as science.

                Throughout my programming "career" I have made alot of applications. I probably have so many folders of
                unfinished projects. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/adamsa09" class="link">Github</a>, I have
                2 projects
                there. 1 was made in my earlier days of coding. I have other projects that I have never published on
                Github
                but I
                probably will. </p>

                    <p class="text">I made this application with python when I first started coding. I then learnt about
                        git, and automatically published it there. Git is extremely useful not only for group projects
                        but
                        for one man projects! This app takes an input then opens up a browser and searches google for
                        the input. It's very simple but helped me get an understanding of web scraping. I could have
                        changed
                        the way it searched by making it go to
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs" class="link">google.com</a> and make it
                        find
                        the search box with <code>driver.findElementById('q')</code> which basically finds the searchbox
                        by
                        it's ID. Then it would type the search term in automatically. I found a much easier and faster
                        way.
                        Basically, I found how the Google search urls work.
                        it goes: https://google.com/search+term. The search term is
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP" class="link">encoded into a url</a>.
                        That was
                        another
                        learning point. Discovering things for yourself.
